Code: What do the fingers do all day after a stroke?

Title: What do the fingers do all day after a stroke?

Code: The code files were written by James Cheetham

Analyser.py: The main python file that analysises the patient data. This expects a config.ini file in the same 
directory and the patient data files to be in subfolders.
ParsePilotData.py: Requries Analyser.py processes the data in pilot/170808 to determine calibration values.

Libraries required
matplotlib 2.1.0
numpy 1.13.3

Output: The Analyser script produces graphs in graphs/, data files in summary/ (directories must exist)

Example Graphs for each sample file

CON1_calibration1_index_max_calibration_points.png: The values derived from the calibration file for the maximum flexion
of the index finger for CON1.
CON1_calibration1_index_max_position_data_with_calibration.png: The Position graph of calibration 1 for CON1 showing the
sample points
CON1_calibration1_index_min_calibratin_points.png: Similar to the max calibration, but showing min values (i.e. extension)
CON1_calibration1_index_min_position_data_with_calibration.png: As the max, but showing min values
CON1_calibration1_index_position_data.png: Graphing of the Position Data over time (s)

These are repeated for the Thumb and for Calibration2 (if relevant)

CON1_index.png: Showing the calibration value difference beteween calibration1 and calibration2
CON1_index_calibration1.png: The Movement of the index finger for calibration1 (repeated for calibration2 and thumb)
CON1_index_trial.png: The Movement of the index finger during the trial
CON1_position_histogram.png: The amount of time the digit spent in various percentiles of maximum flexion during the trial

graphs/summary
These graphs are summary data across all of the sample sets

summary/
These files contain raw data for each patient for each analysis point.
